Dify and Helpman were cubing enthusiasts and were big fans of J-Perm. They had a secret messaging service which used public and private keys. They had an interesting idea to expose their private keys 2 and 3, the second public key 100000, but keep the first public key of their algorithm. They had a secret text to help them remember the secret first public key in case if they ever forget it.

Apparently, in order to make the algorithm more secure, I've heard a rumour that they exchange the "mirror" keys for 'Z' times. Can you help me find the final "mirror" key?
