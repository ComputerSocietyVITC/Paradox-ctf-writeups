# Kvvtz JVtwpsly

THE BOSS LURKS ABOVE THE DARK CLOUDS OF A LIFELESS PLANET CALLED HOME AND THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON WHO CAN SHED SOME LIGHT.

THIS COMPILER CONTAINS THE NAME OF THE DEMON WHO BROUGHT DEVASTATION AND MISERY TO EARTH, BUT THE DEMON HIRED A LAZY PROGRAMMER TO DESTROY THE COMPILER!

MANY EONS AGO, THE DEVIL WAS BORN AND WREAKED HAVOC ON LIFE WHICH ENDED THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS..

IN ORDER TO SEAL HIM AWAY, THERE WAS A SACRED SPELL THAT WAS ABLE TO SEAL THE BOSS AWAY...

IN THE EONS THAT PASSED, 
    TECHNOLOGY HAS IMPROVED
    LANGUAGES HAVE CHANGED
    PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN
    BUT THE THREAT NEVER WENT AWAY.

AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO SEAL THE DEMON FOR GOOD WITH `Kvvtz JVtwpsly` SO,

A COMPILER AND .42 FILE WERE CREATED, TO HELP FIND THE SPELL AND CAST ON THE DEMON.

ALTHOUGH `iisac.42` HAS NOT BEEN TAMPERED, THE COMPILER HAS WEATHERED WITH TIME...

AND `Kvvtz JVtwpsly` HAS BEEN SABOTAGED BY THE BOSS'S MINIONS AND CANNOT GIVE THE DEVIL'S NAME

DESPITE THIS LOOMING CATASTROPHE,

ALL HOPE IS NOT LOST.

TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.

THE DEVIL'S NAME LIES IN THE EXPRESSION OF THE 42.
