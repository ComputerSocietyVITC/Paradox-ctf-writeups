Objective:

To decode an obfuscated script hosted on GitHub and ultimately retrieve an encrypted flag from a Pastebin link.

Procedure:

Access the GitHub Repository:
Navigate to the GitHub repository at github.com/mame/doublehelix.

Locate the Dictionary Mapping:
Within the repository, identify the dictionary that maps binary values to characters. This dictionary is crucial as it translates the binary values into readable characters.

Translate Binary Values:
Use the identified dictionary to replace the binary values in the script with their corresponding characters. This step will convert the binary code into an obfuscated script.

Decrypt the Caesar Cipher:
The script contains a Caesar cipher. Decrypt this cipher to reveal a printable text. A Caesar cipher involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The exact shift value can vary and needs to be determined.

Extract the Pastebin Link:
The decrypted text from the Caesar cipher will lead to a Pastebin link. This link is where the flag is located.

Retrieve the Flag:
Visit the Pastebin link. The flag will be encrypted using Deadfish, an esoteric programming language known for its simplicity and minimalism.



Decrypt the Deadfish Encrypted Flag:
Use a Deadfish interpreter to decrypt the flag. Deadfish has a limited set of operations and typically requires a specialized interpreter or manual decoding.

By following these steps, you can successfully decode the script and retrieve the encrypted flag.
