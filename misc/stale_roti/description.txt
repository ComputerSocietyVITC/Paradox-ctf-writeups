Something's off in my "roti making robot". I want to find some key information about it so that I can try and fix it. Can you help me and find the answers to these questions :)

a) A module seems to not match with the name given in the photo, can you help me find the real module's name??
b) What does the "A" stand for in the name of the module?
c) What function is done when you CLR the MCLR in the module?
d) What's the base of negative infinity in float values of the scripting language used for the module? (give the answer in hex, eg:0x00000001)


flag format: paradox_ctf{a_b_c_d}
Note: All the answers should be given in lowercase.
