Go to the youtube video of Bob1German's seminar in CompSoc channel and there will be a discord link

# Discord link is to be added just before the event starts

The discord link will guide the participants to a newly created discord channel "Carl's Kingdom"
Using the command "!flag" will result in Carl-bot saying "those moderators must be plotting something bad in their hidden channels..." which shows that there are some hidden channels in the server.
This can be found out using betterdiscord or other similar third-party plugins to show hidden channels on discord.

The hidden channel's name is 48657265277320616e6f74686572206f6e653a205a3038736e475173484149 which when converted to text translates to "Here's another one: Z08snGQsHAI" which redirects to another compsoc yt video where the comment will have a base64 encoded flag "cGFyYWRveF9jdGZ7Y2wxM050NV9zMWdoN181MzNNNV83MF9iM19wcjM3N3lfZzAwZH0="

# This base64 encoded flag is to be added just before the event starts

After decoding the base64 encoded flag, you will get the correct flag.
