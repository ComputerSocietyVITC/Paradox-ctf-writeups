Go to the youtube video of Bob1German's seminar in CompSoc channel and there will be a discord link

The discord link will guide the participants to a newly created discord channel "Carl's Kingdom"
Using the command "!flag" will result in Carl-bot saying "those moderators must be plotting something bad in their hidden channels..." which shows that there are some hidden channels in the server.
This can be found out using betterdiscord or other similar third-party plugins to show hidden channels on discord.

The hidden channel's name is 68747470733a2f2f706173746562696e2e636f6d2f5474476b34473639 which when converted to text translates to "https://pastebin.com/TtGk4G69". This pastebin will have a vignere ciphered flag with the key separate from it.

After decoding the encrypted flag, you will get the correct flag.
