Hey there! I need your help. Those reckless hackers broke into my computer and messed with my files. They've encrypted my password and saved it in output.txt. But they seemed to be in a hurry and left part of my original password in flag.txt, but it's partially corrupted.

Can you help me crack their code and get my password back? My Pok√©mon and I are counting on you!
