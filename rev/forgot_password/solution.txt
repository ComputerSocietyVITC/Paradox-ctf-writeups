How the question was made:
1. Split the flag into two equal halves
2. XOR the two equal halves and output the hex-form of the result
3. "Corrupt" the actual flag (remove the 2nd half of the flag)

CTF Attachments: 
1. a.out
2. flag.txt
3. output.txt

Solution:
Method 1:
1. Decompile the `out` file with ghidra/binaryninja or similar decompilers to get a C file
2. Find out what kind of operation is being done with the flag string (in this case it's splititing into two and XOR-ing them) 
3. XOR the hex-form output with the first-half of the flag given in flag.txt to get the second half
4. Join them both to get the final flag

Method 2:
1. Follow till step 2 of the previous method and give a brief description/context and given info about the ctf to chatgpt, it will solve on its own lmao
